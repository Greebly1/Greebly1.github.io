                        <p>First of all, all <strong>player input is seperated into state machines and decoupled completely</strong>, then a designer created <strong>event system specifies how they can communicate</strong>. For instance, the UI select event can tell the locomotion controller to attempt to possess a gameobject it selects</p>
                        <p>Second, the camera controller can switch between dynamic top down, and third person at runtime</p>
                        <p>All pawns use <strong>root motion</strong> to move and implement the <strong>interact interface</strong></p>
                        <p>Lastly, the projectiles use basic <strong>object pooling</strong></p>
