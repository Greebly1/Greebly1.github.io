                        <p>Built inside of Unreal Engine 5 <sub>(all assets made by me)</sub></p>
                        <p>All 3 textures are sampled with <strong>top-down projection</strong></p>
                        <p>Landscape uses UEs landscape material layers to <strong>height blend</strong> the path textures over the grass. Additionally the blending takes into account physics materials for linkage with other systems.</p>
                        <p>Grass and foliage is automatically instanced</p>
                        <p>The material that the foliage uses gradually adjusts hue and saturation according to a vertical gradient. All foliage also uses <strong>vertical split normals</strong> to mimic the same shading as the ground.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            The result is that the foliage blends into the ground below it. Your eyes cannot follow a single blade of grass to its root. Very fluffy and stylized.
                            <br/>
                            Level designers and environment artists can easily <strong>paint where the path should go.</strong> The system was packaged into a zip folder and given to some collegues. On the right is a game jam game <strong><u><a href = "https://lucasfoxworthy.framer.website/">Lucas Foxworthy</a></u></strong> made with my package.

                        <p>What started as an environment for a passion project pivoted towards refining an interesting shader setup.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This ice shader mainly uses <strong>parallax mapping</strong> with a noise texture <sub>The noise is used for colorization</sub>
                        </p>
                        <p>What enables the true ice effect is that the <strong>parallax mapping uses non uniform depth</strong>, the depth is scaled by the noise texture.</p>
                        <p>As a final layer of ice-ness, an icy <strong>normal map</strong> is used alongside some <strong>direct specular</strong></p>
